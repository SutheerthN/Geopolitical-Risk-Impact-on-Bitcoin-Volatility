PROJECT TITLE: Geopolitical Risk Impact on Bitcoin Volatility

SUMMARY:

This project explores the effect of major geopolitical events on the short-term volatility of Bitcoin (BTC), with a focus on analyzing its behavior around global crises. As Bitcoin continues to evolve from a speculative asset to a potential macroeconomic hedge, understanding how it reacts to political shocks is increasingly important for traders, analysts, and institutions.

OBJECTIVE:
To investigate how specific geopolitical flashpoints impact the 7-day rolling volatility of Bitcoin, using historical price data and manual tagging of high-impact global events.

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGY USED:
- Python (Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab)
- yfinance (for downloading historical BTC-USD data)
- pandas (for data manipulation)
- matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)

DATA:
- BTC-USD daily closing price data from Yahoo Finance (2021–2024)
- 3 Geopolitical events were manually selected:
  1. Russia-Ukraine War Start (2022-02-24)
  2. Israel-Gaza Conflict Spike (2023-10-07)
  3. Iran-US Tension Escalation (2024-01-01)

METHODOLOGY:
1. Downloaded BTC price data and calculated daily return and 7-day rolling volatility as a proxy for short-term risk.
2. Defined a ±30-day window around each event.
3. Plotted volatility trends with the geopolitical event date marked clearly.
4. Observed price and volatility changes before, during, and after the events to understand how geopolitical tension influences BTC's market behavior.

KEY FINDINGS:
- During the Russia-Ukraine conflict, BTC volatility nearly doubled within a week of the event, indicating heightened market anxiety.
- The Israel-Gaza conflict caused a moderate spike, showing that BTC is sensitive to Middle Eastern instability, but less dramatically than the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
- The Iran-US tension showed volatility spikes similar to the early days of the pandemic and war, implying that macro-political risks strongly influence crypto volatility.

INSIGHTS:
- Bitcoin often acts like a "risk-on" asset (like tech stocks) during geopolitical shocks, rather than as a consistent safe-haven like gold.
- This behavior presents both opportunity and risk for traders and institutions during times of uncertainty.
- Understanding volatility patterns around macro events is critical for building trading strategies and risk management models.

RELEVANCE TO FUTURES FIRST:
This project is highly aligned with Futures First’s core focus:
- Demonstrates a strong understanding of market volatility and global macroeconomic triggers.
- Applies quantitative reasoning, data visualization, and real-world finance analysis.
- Highlights skills essential to proprietary trading: risk analysis, fast decision-making, and data-driven judgment.

CONCLUSION:
The project proves that combining global awareness with market analytics can yield meaningful trading insights. Bitcoin is highly sensitive to geopolitical developments, and this volatility creates strategic opportunities for traders. A firm like Futures First can leverage such insights to inform trading decisions in both crypto and traditional derivative markets.
